## Hello everyone, I am Christopher, aka Iki! ðŸ‘‹
I am a 20-year-old backend developer living in Italy. I am very passionate about anything that has to do with technology; currently, I am working on small projects and web development stuff. I also like other things, like game or graphics development.

I can tell you other things about me! My favorite (and first) language is C++, even though I'm not using it that much. At the moment, I am working with and Java, Spring and AWS at their full potential, as I am working mainly on backend related works. I can also code in Python, Javascript and many other languages. 

I kinda like languages with a verbose syntax, but Python was actually the language that introduced me to the more advanced programming world.

Well, I like to learn new things every day (a LOT of new things), and I'm never going to stop learning.
