## Hello everyone, I am Christopher, aka Ikiwq! ðŸ‘‹
I am a 21-year-old software engineer living in Italy. I am very passionate about anything that has to do with technology; currently, I am working at Humans.tech as a Backend Engineer, bulding stuff with Typescript and other cool things.

I can tell you other things about me! My favorite (and first) language is C++, even though I'm not using it that much. For most of my career I worked with and Java, Spring and AWS and other tools, such as Kafka, Mysql and MongoDB. 

I also worked for some time as a frontend and mobile development with Typescript, React and React Native. Sometimes I like to build little projects with these. I can also code in Python and Assembly with the NASM compiler.

I love to learn new things and getting through mind-boggling problems every day.
